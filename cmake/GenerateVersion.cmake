# What the game says about itself: the version it was given, and the moment
# this particular build was made.
#
# The version comes from the VERSION file, moved on at release time; the
# stamp is taken here at every build, so that two builds of the same version
# are still told apart -- which is what a version alone cannot do for
# something that is rebuilt rather than released.
#
# Written in two forms: a source file for the program to carry, and a bare
# line for the packaging to read, cpack running long after the compiler has
# finished.
#
# Avec RELEASE, pas d'empreinte du tout : une version se nomme par son numéro
# et rien d'autre, et deux paquets d'une même version n'ont pas à se
# distinguer -- il n'y en a qu'un. C'est la cible release qui le demande, et
# elle seule ; voir CMakeLists.txt.

# Packaging builds the program again from inside cpack, after cpack has read
# the version it is naming the package with. Stamping it again there would
# put one version on the package and a later one in the binary inside it, so
# while packaging the stamp is left alone.
